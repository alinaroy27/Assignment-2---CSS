The new CSS property i used is:
a)display: flex;
b)justify-content: center;
c)gap: 30px;

1. display: flex is used for controlling the size and behavior of items within a flexible container.
   justify-content: center aligns the container in the center.
   gap: 30px provides a gap of 30px around the containers.

2. I used it in navigation bar.
